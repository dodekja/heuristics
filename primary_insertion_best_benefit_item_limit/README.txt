To succesfully run the heuristic, insert names of files with weights and prices of the items. Filenames must include the file format.
Valid filenames look like this: "weights.txt" and "prices.txt". These are included in the project directory,
however, custom filenames can be used too.
Then, insert the maximum carrying capacity of the knapsack. This value represents the maximum weight of items included in the knapsack.
At last, insert the maximum item capacity of the knapsack. This value represents the highest number of items that can be inserted into the knapsack
The results will be printed into console and into "solution.txt" file. Results include free carrying and item capacity after the computation, sum of prices of items in the knapsack and a list of items in the knapsack.
